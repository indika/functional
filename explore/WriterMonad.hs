-- What's going on?
-- I have a function that let's me decide things
-- Why do I need an applyLog?
-- Well, I need an application function
-- Because I have a history, and I want to create a future
-- However, not quite
-- Because, my past is of type Integer (antes)
-- and my future, is of type Bool (despues)

main :: IO ()
main = undefined



applyLog' :: (a, [c]) -> (a -> (b, [c])) -> (b, [c])
applyLog' = undefined


-- K, I need to pull tho inner string out and join it with the second
applyLog :: (Int, [Char]) -> (Int -> (Bool, [Char])) -> (Bool, [Char])
applyLog (v, log) df = let (y, log') = df v in (y, log ++ log')

-- Remember how the let expression looks:
--      pattern = let intermediate = source in target


-- OK. Here is a new problem
-- A function is evaluated
-- I *know* that the function returns a tuple
-- I want something inside that tuple
-- I'm pretty sure that I can pattern match on it
-- I'm thinking of using where statement with an @pat something
-- But mostly probably what I really need is the let clause
-- that I don't really understand how to use



-- So, there is a decision function somewhere around here

-- [?] Something that I am yet to understand.
-- And when can I use the actual type?
-- This is what I would like to do:
-- decider :: a -> (b, [Char])
-- but, now I'm going to resort to
-- decider :: Int -> (Bool, [Char])

decider :: Int -> (Bool, [Char])
decider x
    | x < 9     =  (False, "less than")
    | otherwise =  (True, "greater than")

decider'' :: Int -> (Bool, Thneed)
decider'' x
    | x < 9     =  (False, Thneed "less than")
    | otherwise =  (True, Thneed "greater than")



-- Ok cool
-- What am I going to do with Monoids now?

-- Monoids is about joining things
-- I can declare some thing, and then I can declare that it is joinable

data Thneed = Thneed String
    deriving Show

-- OK: Now I want to make this Thneed composable

instance Monoid Thneed where
    mempty = Thneed ""
    (Thneed x) `mappend` (Thneed y) = Thneed (x ++ y)


someThneed = Thneed "Something that you need"


-- The first step of generalizing
--applyLog'' :: (Int, Thneed) -> (Int -> (Bool, Thneed)) -> (Bool, Thneed)
--applyLog'' (v, log) df = let (y, log') = df v in (y, log `mappend` log')

-- I think that I can generalize it even more
applyLog'' :: Monoid c => (Int, c) -> (Int -> (Bool, c)) -> (Bool, c)
applyLog'' (v, log) df = let (y, log') = df v in (y, log `mappend` log')


-- So, in brief, what do I do?
-- I was apply ++ on a type
-- I realized that it was a join
-- Made it into an instance of the Monoid type class
-- Replaced the function declaration of it, with a type variable
-- and made that into an instance of a Monoid







--test = decider 7
test = applyLog'' (7, Thneed "this is the past") decider''
