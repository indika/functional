* How do I find factors
    if a number t / x has no remainder,
        then it is a factor

    so the list of all of these
    excluding 1 and itself


* How do I find out if a number is prime
    well... it has no factors,
        excluding 1 and itself


* should i cache things?


"Prime Factorization" is finding which prime numbers multiply together to make the original number.


"Factor Tree" can help:
    find any factors of the number,
    then the factors of those numbers,
    etc, until we can't factor any more.

It is like the Prime Numbers are the basic building blocks of all numbers.
