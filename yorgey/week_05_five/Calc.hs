module Calc where

import ExprT



-- EXERCISE 1

-- This type is capable of representing expressions involving integer constants, addition, and multiplication. For example, the expression (2 + 3) Ã— 4 would be represented by the value
-- Mul (Add (Lit 2) (Lit 3)) (Lit 4)

-- Write Version 1 of the calculator: an evaluator for ExprT, with the signature
-- For example, eval (Mul (Add (Lit 2) (Lit 3)) (Lit 4)) == 20.
