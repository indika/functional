-- EXERCISE 1

-- This type is capable of representing expressions involving integer constants, addition, and multiplication. For example, the expression (2 + 3) × 4 would be represented by the value
-- Mul (Add (Lit 2) (Lit 3)) (Lit 4)

-- Write Version 1 of the calculator: an evaluator for ExprT, with the signature
-- For example, eval (Mul (Add (Lit 2) (Lit 3)) (Lit 4)) == 20.

-- EXERCISE 2

-- Parser.hs exports parseExp, which is a parser for arithmetic expressions
-- passing the constructors of ExprT to it as arguments
-- it will convert Strings representing arithmetic expressions into values
-- of type ExprT

-- *Calc> parseExp Lit Add Mul "(2+3)*4"
-- Just (Mul (Add (Lit 2) (Lit 3)) (Lit 4))

-- *Calc> parseExp Lit Add Mul "2+3*"
-- Nothing



-- Implement a value added function
-- which evaluates a String,
-- producing Nothing for inputs which are not well-formed
-- and Just n for well-formed inputs that evaluate to n

-- Decision to abstract away the properties of ExprT with a type class
-- Create a type class called Expr with three methods
-- lit, add and mul
-- which parallel the constructors of ExprT

-- Make an instance of Expr for the ExprT type
-- in such a way that
-- mul (add (lit 2) (lit 3)) (lit 4) :: ExprT
--   == Mul (Add (Lit 2) (Lit 3)) (Lit 4)

-- Think carefully about what types lit, add and mul should have
-- it may be helpful to consider the types of the ExprT constructors
-- by typing :t Lit




-- What are the types that I'm dealing with
-- I think I'm only dealing with one type
-- With different values (Lit, Add, Mul)
-- I have something like this:

 --data ExprT  = Lit Integer
 --            | Add ExprT ExprT
 --            | Mul ExprT ExprT
 --  deriving (Show, Eq)


-- The point of our Expr type class is that we can now write down arithmetic expressions once
-- and have them interpreted in various ways just by using them at various types.
--class Expr a where
--    lit :: a -> ExprT
--    add :: a -> a -> ExprT
--    mul :: a -> a -> ExprT

--class Expr a where
--    lit :: Integer -> a

-- i think what this is about is,
-- the result of the calculation is interpreted as True or False
--
-- interpreted as False: every literal value less than or equal to 0
-- False :=: lit x <= 0
-- interpreted as True: all positive Integers
-- True :=: positive Integers
-- and all positive Integers are interpreted as True; “addition” is logical or, “multiplication” is logical and
-- addition: is, logical or
-- multiplication: is, logical and


instance Expr Bool where
    lit x
        | x <= 0    = False
        | otherwise = True
    add x y = x || y
    mul x y = x && y

-- “addition” is taken to be the max function,
-- while “multiplication” is the min function
instance Expr MinMax where
    lit x = MinMax x
    add x y = max x y

-- all values should be in the ranage 0 . . . 6,
-- and all arithmetic is done modulo 7; for example,
-- 5 + 3 = 1.
--instance Expr Mod7 where
--    lit x = Mod7 (mod x 7)
--    add x y = mod (x + y) 7
--    mul x y =  mod (x * y) 7


-- there is a good reason why I can only write this is GHCI
--example = mul (add (lit 2) (lit 3)) (lit 4)

-- GHCI tells me that this is Maybe ExprT
--testExp :: Expr a => Maybe a
--testExp = parseExp lit add mul "(3 * -4) + 5"

--testInteger = testExp :: Maybe Integer


-- If I just get the type in GHCI
-- parseExp lit add mul "(3 * -4) + 5" :: Maybe ExprT

reify = id


-- DO THIS
-- Constrast
-- parseExp lit add mul "(3 * -4) + 5"
-- with
-- parseExp Lit Add Mul "(2+3)*4"
-- the second one operates with ExprT types
-- the first one operates with functions

-- Start here:
-- parseExp
--  :: (Integer -> a)
--     -> (a -> a -> a) -> (a -> a -> a) -> String -> Maybe a

-- :t parseExp Lit ExprT.Add ExprT.Mul "(2+3)*4" :: Maybe ExprT
-- :t parseExp lit add mul "(3 * -4) + 5" :: Expr a => Maybe a
-- the second one takes any type. well, it's how it is defined

-- now how do I fix the type?




-- EXERCISE 5

-- StackVM.hs, which is a software simulation of the custom CPU.
-- The CPU supports six operations, as embodied in the StackExp data type:

--data StackExp = PushI Integer
--              | PushB Bool
--              | Add
--              | Mul
--              | And
--              | Or
--                deriving Show

--type Program = [StackExp]


-- PushI and PushB push values onto the top of the stack,
-- which can store both Integer and Bool values.
-- Add, Mul, And, and Or each pop the top two items off the top of the stack, perform the appropriate operation,
-- and push the result back onto the top of the stack.

-- For example, executing the program
-- [PushB True, PushI 3, PushI 6, Mul]
-- will result in a stack holding True on the bottom, and 18 on top of that.


--If there are not enough operands on top of the stack,
-- or if an operation is performed on operands of the wrong type, the processor will melt into a puddle of silicon goo.
-- For a more precise specification of the capabilities and behavior of the custom CPU, consult the reference implementation provided in StackVM.hs.

-- Your task is to implement a compiler for arithmetic expressions.
-- Simply create an instance of the Expr type class for Program, so that arithmetic expressions can be interpreted as compiled programs.
-- For any arithmetic expression exp :: Expr a => a it should be the case that

-- stackVM exp == Right [IVal exp]

-- Finally, put together the pieces you have to create a function
-- compile :: String -> Maybe Program

-- which takes Strings representing arithmetic expressions and compiles
-- them into programs that can be run on the custom CPU.
