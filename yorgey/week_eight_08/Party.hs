-- maximise the amount of fun

-- Obvious way would be [Employee]
-- But don't want to recompute Fun scores every time
-- GuestList contais both a list of Employees and a Fun score
-- Values of type GuestList should always satisfy the invariant that
-- the sum of all the Fun scores in the list of Employees should be
-- equal to the one, “cached” Fun score.

-- data GuestList = GL [Employee] Fun
--   deriving (Show, Eq)

-- instance Ord GuestList where
--   compare (GL _ f1) (GL _ f2) = compare f1 f2




-- Define tools for working with GuestLists

-- EXERCISE 1.1
-- glCons :: Employee -> GuestList -> GuestList

-- which adds an Employee to the GuestList
-- (updating the cached Fun score appropriately).

-- Of course, in general this is impossible:
-- the updated fun score should depend on whether the Employee being added is already in the list,
-- or if any of their direct subordinates are in the list, and so on.
-- For our purposes, though, you may assume that none of these special cases will hold:
-- that is, glCons should simply add the new Employee and
-- add their fun score without doing any kind of checks.

-- EXERCISE 1.2
-- A Monoid instance for GuestList.
-- (How is the Monoid instance supposed to work, you ask? You figure it out!)


instance Monoid GuestList where
    mempty = GL [] 0
    mappend x@(GL l1 f1) y@(GL l2 f2) = GL (l1 ++ l2) (f1 + f2)




-- EXERCISE 1.3
-- moreFun :: GuestList -> GuestList -> GuestList

-- which takes two GuestLists and returns whichever one of them is more fun,
-- i.e. has the higher fun score.
-- (If the scores are equal it does not matter which is returned.)
