-- Fibonacci numbers
-- TODO: See the Euler problem



-- The Fibonacci numbers Fn are deﬁned as the sequence of integers,
-- beginning with 0 and 1, where every integer in the sequence is the
-- sum of the previous two. That is,
-- F0 = 0
-- F1 = 1
-- Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2 (n ≥ 2)

-- For example, the ﬁrst ﬁfteen Fibonacci numbers are
-- 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, . . .

-- It’s quite likely that you’ve heard of the Fibonacci numbers before.
-- The reason they’re so famous probably has something to do with the
-- simplicity of their deﬁnition combined with the astounding variety of
-- ways that they show up in various areas of mathematics as well as art
-- and nature.


-- EXERCISE 1

-- Translate the above deﬁnition of Fibonacci numbers directly into a
-- recursive function deﬁnition of type
-- so that fib n computes the nth Fibonacci number Fn.

fib :: Integer -> Integer
fib x
    | x == 0 = 0
    | x == 1 = 1
    | otherwise = fib (x - 1) + fib (x - 2)

-- Now use fib to deﬁne the inﬁnite list of all Fibonacci numbers,
fibs1 :: [Integer]
fibs1 = map fib positive_integers
    where positive_integers = [0..]



-- (Hint: You can write the list of all positive integers as [0..].)
-- Try evaluating fibs1 at the ghci prompt. You will probably get
-- bored watching it after the ﬁrst 30 or so Fibonacci numbers, because
-- fib is ridiculously slow. Although it is a good way to deﬁne the Fi
-- bonacci numbers, it is not a very good way to compute them—in order
-- to compute Fn it essentially ends up adding 1 to itself Fn times!

-- For example, shown at right is the tree of recursive calls made by evaluat- ing fib 5.
-- As you can see, it does a lot of repeated work. In the end, fib has running time
-- O(Fn), which (it turns out) is equivalent to O(ro squared) where ro = 1 + root 5 / 2
-- is the golden ratio
-- That’s right, the running time is exponential in n.
-- What’s more, all this work is also repeated from each element of the list fibs1 to the next.
-- Surely we can do better.




-- EXERCISE 2

-- Your task for this exercise is to come up with more efficient implementation.
-- Specifically, define the infinite list

-- fibs2 :: [Integer]
-- so that it has the same elements as fibs1,
-- but computing the first n elements of fibs2 requires only O(n) addition operations.
-- Be sure to use standard recursion pattern(s) from the Prelude as appropriate.
