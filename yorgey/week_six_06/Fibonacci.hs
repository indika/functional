-- Fibonacci numbers
-- TODO: See the Euler problem



-- The Fibonacci numbers Fn are deﬁned as the sequence of integers,
-- beginning with 0 and 1, where every integer in the sequence is the
-- sum of the previous two. That is,
-- F0 = 0
-- F1 = 1
-- Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2 (n ≥ 2)

-- For example, the ﬁrst ﬁfteen Fibonacci numbers are
-- 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, . . .

-- It’s quite likely that you’ve heard of the Fibonacci numbers before.
-- The reason they’re so famous probably has something to do with the
-- simplicity of their deﬁnition combined with the astounding variety of
-- ways that they show up in various areas of mathematics as well as art
-- and nature.


-- EXERCISE 1

-- Translate the above deﬁnition of Fibonacci numbers directly into a
-- recursive function deﬁnition of type
-- so that fib n computes the nth Fibonacci number Fn.

fib :: Integer -> Integer
fib x
    | x == 0 = 0
    | x == 1 = 1
    | otherwise = fib (x - 1) + fib (x - 2)

-- Now use fib to deﬁne the inﬁnite list of all Fibonacci numbers,
fibs1 :: [Integer]
fibs1 = map fib positive_integers
    where positive_integers = [0..]



-- (Hint: You can write the list of all positive integers as [0..].)
-- Try evaluating fibs1 at the ghci prompt. You will probably get
-- bored watching it after the ﬁrst 30 or so Fibonacci numbers, because
-- fib is ridiculously slow. Although it is a good way to deﬁne the Fi
-- bonacci numbers, it is not a very good way to compute them—in order
-- to compute Fn it essentially ends up adding 1 to itself Fn times!

-- For example, shown at right is the tree of recursive calls made by evaluating fib 5.
-- As you can see, it does a lot of repeated work. In the end, fib has running time
-- O(Fn), which (it turns out) is equivalent to O(ro squared) where ro = 1 + root 5 / 2
-- is the golden ratio
-- That’s right, the running time is exponential in n.
-- What’s more, all this work is also repeated from each element of the list fibs1 to the next.

-- What is this thing?
-- It is a sequence. It's value is basically the sum of the previous two values.
-- The initial calculation of it does not use the previous value.
-- It does everything again.
-- If there are n items, then it has to do n steps.
-- Each successive element requires exponential growth.






-- EXERCISE 2

-- Your task for this exercise is to come up with more efficient implementation.
-- Specifically, define the infinite list

-- fibs2 :: [Integer]
-- so that it has the same elements as fibs1,
-- but computing the first n elements of fibs2 requires only O(n) addition operations.
-- Be sure to use standard recursion pattern(s) from the Prelude as appropriate.

-- Ok, use the previous two values

-- Consider a reversed list, take the head and the head of the rest


finite_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
b' = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
b = [8, 5, 3, 2, 1]
z = []


sumOfFirstTwo :: [Integer] -> Integer
sumOfFirstTwo (x:xs) = x + head xs

gl [] x = [1]
gl [1] x = [2, 1]
gl acc x = sumOfFirstTwo acc : acc

gr x [] = [1]
gr x [1] = [2, 1]
gr x acc = sumOfFirstTwo acc : acc


-- This creates a new list for each new number
-- I just need to produce an infinite list of fib integers
fibs2 :: [[Integer]]
fibs2 = scanl gl [] positive_integers
    where positive_integers = [0..]


myFold f z [] = z
myFold f z (x:xs) = x `f` (myFold f z xs)

something = myFold gr []
bob = foldr gr []
lbob = foldl' gl []





-- STREAMS

-- Define a Stream type representing lists that must be infinite
-- This way we can be more explicit about infinite lists
-- Usual list type represents both infinite, and finite
-- In particular, streams are like lists but with only a “cons” constructor
-- (whereas the list type has two constructors, [] (the empty list) and (:) (cons) )
-- There is no such thing as an empty stream.
-- So a stream is simply defined as an element followed by a stream.


-- EXERCISE 3

-- Define a data type of polymorphic streams, Stream.

data Stream a = a :. Stream a

--data Stream a = InfiniteCons a (Stream a)
--    deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

-- How do I create the first stream?

--a_stream = 1 :. 2 :. 3



-- Write a function to convert a Stream to an infinite list,

streamToList :: Stream a -> [a]
streamToList (x :. y) = x : streamToList y
-- streamToList (InfiniteCons x y) = x : streamToList y



-- Have an instance of Show for Streams
-- This will help test the Stream functions in the succeeding exercises
-- Deriving Show is in sufficient, because the resulting instance will try to print on when it finishes
-- Instead, make my own instance of Show

instance Show a => Show (Stream a) where
    show stream = take 20 (streamToList stream)

-- which works by showing only some prefix of a stream (say, the first 20 elements).
-- Hint: you may find your streamToList function useful.





-- EXERCISE 4

-- Let’s create some simple tools for working with Streams.

-- • Write a function
--    streamRepeat :: a -> Stream a

-- This generates a stream containing infinitely many copies of the given element

-- • Write a function
-- streamMap :: (a -> b) -> Stream a -> Stream b
-- which applies a function to every element of a Stream.

-- • Write a function
--    streamFromSeed :: (a -> a) -> a -> Stream a

-- which generates a Stream from a “seed” of type a,
-- this "seed", is the first element of the stream,
-- and an "unfolding rule" of type a -> a
-- this specifies how to transform the seed into a new seed
-- and be used for generating the rest of the stream





-- EXERCISE 5

-- Create a few streams, with the tools we have now

-- An inifinite list of natural numbers 0, 1, 2, . . .
-- • Define the stream
--    nats :: Stream Integer


-- The ruler function
-- 0,1,0,2,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,4,...
-- where the nth element in the stream (assuming the first element corresponds to n = 1)
-- is the largest power of 2 which evenly divides n.
-- Try to implement this in a clever way that does not do any divisibility testing

-- • Define the stream
--    ruler :: Stream Integer

-- Hint: define a function interleaveStreams which alternates the elements from two streams.






-- FIBONACCI NUMBERS VIA GENERATING FUNCTIONS (EXTRA CREDIT)

-- This section is optional but very cool, so if you have time I hope you will try it.
-- We will use streams of Integers to compute the Fibonacci numbers in an astounding way.
-- The essential idea is to work with generating functions of the form a0 +a1x+a2x2 +···+anxn +...
-- where x is just a “formal parameter”
-- (that is, we will never actually substitute any values for x; we just use it as a placeholder)
-- and all the coefficients ai are integers.
-- We will store the coefficients a0, a1, a2, . . . in a Stream Integer.


-- Exercise 6 (Optional) • First, define
--   x :: Stream Integer
-- by noting that x = 0 + 1x + 0x2 + 0x3 + . . . .
-- • Define an instance of the Num type class for Stream Integer.
-- Here’s what should go in your Num instance:
