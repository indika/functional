-- EXERCISE 1

-- This type is capable of representing expressions
-- involving integer constants, addition, and multiplication.

-- Write Version 1 of the calculator:
-- an evaluator for ExprT
-- For example, eval (Mul (Add (Lit 2) (Lit 3)) (Lit 4)) == 20.

eval :: ExprT.ExprT -> Integer
eval (ExprT.Add (ExprT.Lit x) (ExprT.Lit y)) = x + y
eval (ExprT.Add x (ExprT.Lit y)) = eval x + y
eval (ExprT.Add (ExprT.Lit x) y) = x + eval y
eval (ExprT.Add x y) = eval x + eval y

eval (ExprT.Mul (ExprT.Lit x) (ExprT.Lit y)) = x * y
eval (ExprT.Mul x (ExprT.Lit y)) = eval x * y
eval (ExprT.Mul (ExprT.Lit x) y) = x * eval y
eval (ExprT.Mul x y) = eval x * eval y




-- EXERCISE 2

-- Parser.hs exports parseExp, which is a parser for arithmetic expressions
-- passing the constructors of ExprT to it as arguments
-- it will convert Strings representing arithmetic expressions into values
-- of type ExprT

-- *Calc> parseExp Lit Add Mul "(2+3)*4"
-- Just (Mul (Add (Lit 2) (Lit 3)) (Lit 4))

-- *Calc> parseExp Lit Add Mul "2+3*4"
-- Just (Add (Lit 2) (Mul (Lit 3) (Lit 4)))

-- *Calc> parseExp Lit Add Mul "2+3*"
-- Nothing



-- Implement a value added function
-- which evaluates a String,
-- producing Nothing for inputs which are not well-formed
-- and Just n for well-formed inputs that evaluate to n
evalStr' :: Maybe ExprT.ExprT -> Maybe Integer
evalStr' Nothing = Nothing
evalStr' (Just x) = Just (eval x)

evalStr :: String -> Maybe Integer
evalStr str = evalStr' result
    where result = parseExp ExprT.Lit ExprT.Add ExprT.Mul str



-- EXERCISE 3

-- Decision to abstract away the properties of ExprT with a type class
-- Create a type class called Expr with three methods
-- lit, add and mul
-- which parallel the constructors of ExprT

-- Make an instance of Expr for the ExprT type
-- in such a way that
-- mul (add (lit 2) (lit 3)) (lit 4) :: ExprT
--   == Mul (Add (Lit 2) (Lit 3)) (Lit 4)

-- Think carefully about what types lit, add and mul should have
-- it may be helpful to consider the types of the ExprT constructors
-- by typing :t Lit




-- What are the types that I'm dealing with
-- I think I'm only dealing with one type
-- With different values (Lit, Add, Mul)
-- I have something like this:

 --data ExprT  = Lit Integer
 --            | Add ExprT ExprT
 --            | Mul ExprT ExprT
 --  deriving (Show, Eq)


-- The point of our Expr type class is that we can now write down arithmetic expressions once
-- and have them interpreted in various ways just by using them at various types.

    lit :: Integer -> a

-- i think what this is about is,
-- the result of the calculation is interpreted as True or False
--
-- interpreted as False: every literal value less than or equal to 0
-- False :=: lit x <= 0
-- interpreted as True: all positive Integers
-- True :=: positive Integers
-- and all positive Integers are interpreted as True; “addition” is logical or, “multiplication” is logical and
-- addition: is, logical or
-- multiplication: is, logical and


instance Expr Bool where

        | x <= 0    = False
        | otherwise = True

-- there is a good reason why I can only write this is GHCI

-- :t parseExp Lit ExprT.Add ExprT.Mul "(2+3)*4" :: Maybe ExprT
-- :t parseExp lit add mul "(3 * -4) + 5" :: Expr a => Maybe a
-- the second one takes any type. well, it's how it is defined

-- now how do I fix the type?




-- EXERCISE 5

-- StackVM.hs is a software simulation of the custom CPU.
-- The CPU supports six operations
-- the StackExp data type embodies this:

-- data StackExp = PushI Integer
--               | PushB Bool
--               | Add
--               | Mul
--               | And
--               | Or
--                 deriving Show

-- type Program = [StackExp]


-- There is a stack
-- PushI (stores Integer) and PushB (stores Bool) push values onto the top of the stack,

-- Add, Mul, And, and Or each pop the top two items off the top of the stack, perform the appropriate operation,
-- and push the result back onto the top of the stack.

-- For example, executing the program
-- [PushB True, PushI 3, PushI 6, Mul]
-- will result in a stack holding True on the bottom, and 18 on top of that.

-- Silicon goo can happen if
-- * If there are not enough operands on top of the stack,
-- * or if an operation is performed on operands of the wrong type

-- For a more precise specification of the capabilities and behavior of the custom CPU, consult the reference implementation provided in StackVM.hs.

-- Your task is to implement a compiler for arithmetic expressions.

-- Simply create an instance of the Expr type class for Program, so that arithmetic expressions can be interpreted as compiled programs.
-- For any arithmetic expression exp :: Expr a => a it should be the case that

-- stackVM exp == Right (IVal exp)

-- Finally, put together the pieces you have to create a function
-- compile :: String -> Maybe Program

-- which takes Strings representing arithmetic expressions and compiles
-- them into programs that can be run on the custom CPU.



instance Expr StackVM.Program where
    lit x = [StackVM.PushI x]
    add x y = [StackVM.Add] ++ x ++ y
    mul x y = [StackVM.Mul] ++ x ++ y

testStackExp :: Expr a => Maybe a
testStackExp = parseExp lit add mul "(3+4)*(2+7)"
testStack  = testStackExp :: Maybe StackVM.Program


compile :: String -> Maybe StackVM.Program
compile arithmetic = expression :: Maybe StackVM.Program
                     where expression = parseExp lit add mul arithmetic

-- I have instances of class methods which respond to type Integer, and type Program




-- EXERCISE 6
-- Some users of your calculator have requested the ability to give
-- names to intermediate values and then reuse these stored values later.

-- To enable this, you first need to give arithmetic expressions the ability to contain variables.
-- Create a new type class HasVars a which contains a single method var :: String -> a.
-- Thus, types which are instances of HasVars have some notion of named variables.

class HasVars a where
    var :: String -> a

-- Start out by creating a new data type VarExprT which is the same as ExprT
-- but with an extra constructor for variables.
-- Make VarExprT an instance of both Expr and HasVars.

-- How do I do this without specifying a new module?
-- import qualified
-- maybe required to avoid a name collision
data VarExprT = Lit Integer
            | Add VarExprT VarExprT
            | Mul VarExprT VarExprT
            | Var String
  deriving (Show, Eq)

instance Expr VarExprT where
    lit = Lit
    add = Add
    mul = Mul

instance HasVars VarExprT where
    var = Var

vreify :: VarExprT -> VarExprT
vreify = id


-- You should now be able to write things like
-- *Calc> add (lit 3) (var "x") :: VarExprT

-- But we can’t stop there: we want to be able to interpret expressions containing variables,
-- given a suitable mapping from variables to values.

-- For storing mappings from variables to values, you should use the Data.Map module. Add
-- import qualified Data.Map as M
-- at the top of your file.
-- The qualified import means that you must prefix M. whenever you refer to things from Data.Map.
-- This is standard practice, since Data.Map exports quite a few functions with
-- names that overlap with names from the Prelude.
-- Consult the Data.Map documentation to read about the operations that are supported on Maps.


something :: M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer
something bob = Just 4

bl = [("one", 1), ("two", 2), ("three", 3), ("four", 4)]


-- The first instance says that variables can be interpreted as
-- functions from a mapping of variables to Integer values to (possibly) Integer values.
-- It should work by looking up the variable in the mapping.


doLookup :: String -> M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer
doLookup str map
    | not (M.member str map) = Nothing
    | M.member str map       = Just (map M.! str)


anotherLookup :: Integer -> M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer
anotherLookup int map = Just 99

combine :: (M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer) -> (M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer) -> Maybe Integer
combine x y = Just 4

--thirdLookup :: M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer -> M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer
--thirdLookup x y = Just 5

-- Look up the variable in the mapping
-- String -> (M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer)
-- basically do a lookup on the map
instance HasVars (M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer) where
    var = doLookup


-- The second instance says that these same functions can be interpreted as expressions
-- (by passing along the mapping to subexpressions and combining results appropriately).
instance Expr (M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer) where
    lit x m = Just x
    add x y m = combine x y
    mul x y m = combine x y


--instance HasVars (M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer) where
--  var str map = M.lookup str map

--instance Expr (M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer) where
--  lit int map = Just int
--  mul f1 f2 map = (*) <$> f1 map <*> f2 map
--  add f1 f2 map = (+) <$> f1 map <*> f2 map



-- Note: to write these instances you will need to enable the FlexibleInstances language extension
-- {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}

-- Once you have created these instances, you should be able to test them as follows:

withVars :: [(String, Integer)]
          -> (M.Map String Integer -> Maybe Integer)
          -> Maybe Integer
withVars vs exp = exp $ M.fromList vs

-- *Calc> :t add (lit 3) (var "x")
-- add (lit 3) (var "x") :: (Expr a, HasVars a) => a


-- :t add (lit 3) (lit 3)
-- :: Expr a => a

-- :t add (lit 3) (lit 3) :: VarExprT
-- VarExprT :: VarExprT

-- :t add (lit 3) (var "x") :: VarExprT
-- add (lit 3) (var "x") :: VarExprT :: VarExprT

-- :t add (lit 3) (lit 3) $ M.fromList [("x", 6)]
-- :: (Num a, Expr (M.Map [Char] a -> t)) => t

-- :t add (lit 3) (var "x") $ M.fromList [("x", 6)]
--  :: (Num a, HasVars (M.Map [Char] a -> t), Expr (M.Map [Char] a -> t)) => t



-- START WITH THE END IN MIND

--bexp = add (lit 3) (lit 3) :: Maybe Integer
-- *Calc> withVars ([("x", 6)]) (add (lit 3) (lit 3))
-- *Calc> withVars [("x", 6)] $ add (lit 3) (lit 3)
-- Just 9

-- *Calc> withVars [("x", 6)] $ add (lit 3) (var "x")
-- Just 9

-- *Expr> withVars [("x", 6)] $ add (lit 3) (var "y")
-- Nothing

-- *Calc> withVars [("x", 6), ("y", 3)]
--Just 54
