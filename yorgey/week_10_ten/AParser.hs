-- A parser for a value of type a is a function which takes a String
-- represnting the input to be parsed, and succeeds or fails; if it
-- succeeds, it returns the parsed value along with the remainder of
-- the input.
newtype Parser a = Parser { runParser :: String -> Maybe (a, String) }

-- For example, 'satisfy' takes a predicate on Char, and constructs a
-- parser which succeeds only if it sees a Char that satisfies the
-- predicate (which it then returns).  If it encounters a Char that
-- does not satisfy the predicate (or an empty input), it fails.
satisfy :: (Char -> Bool) -> Parser Char
satisfy p = Parser f
  where
    f [] = Nothing    -- fail on the empty input
    f (x:xs)          -- check if x satisfies the predicate
                        -- if so, return x along with the remainder
                        -- of the input (that is, xs)
        | p x       = Just (x, xs)
        | otherwise = Nothing  -- otherwise, fail

-- Using satisfy, we can define the parser 'char c' which expects to
-- see exactly the character c, and fails otherwise.
char :: Char -> Parser Char
char c = satisfy (== c)

{- For example:

  *Parser> runParser (satisfy isUpper) "ABC"
  Just ('A',"BC")

  *Parser> runParser (satisfy isUpper) "abc"
  Nothing

  *Parser> runParser (char 'x') "xyz"
  Just ('x',"yz")

-- Your code goes below here

-- EXERCISE 1
-- First, you’ll need to implement a Functor instance for Parser.
-- Hint: You may find it useful to implement a function

first :: (a -> b) -> (a,c) -> (b,c)
first g (x, y) = (g x, y)


instance Functor Parser where
  fmap g pa = Parser (fmap mk fn)
    where mk = fmap $ first g
          fn = runParser pa




-- EXERCISE 2
-- Implement an Applicative instance for Parser

-- • pure a represents the parser which consumes no input and successfully returns a result of a.
-- • p1 <*> p2 represents the parser


-- I need to yield something of type: String -> Maybe(b, String)
-- I think the first String is the original String
-- And b is just the second type that I want to parse [?]
-- Or it is the

-- p1 :: String -> Maybe((a->b), String)
-- p2 :: String -> Maybe(a, String)

instance Applicative Parser where
  p1 <*> p2 = Parser (nice)
    where
      rp1 = runParser p1
      rp2 = runParser p2
      semi = fnq rp2
      nice = semi rp1


runTwo :: (String -> Maybe(b, String)) -> Maybe(a, String) -> Maybe(b, String)
runTwo _ Nothing = Nothing
runTwo rp2 (Just(x, str)) = rp2 str

fnq :: (String -> Maybe(b, String)) -> (String -> Maybe(a, String)) -> Maybe(b, String)
fnq _ _ Nothing = Nothing
fnq rp2 _ (Just(x, str)) = rp2 str


something :: String -> Maybe(c, String) -> Maybe(a, String)
something str _ = Nothing

other :: (c -> a) -> Maybe(c, String) -> Maybe(a, String)
other g Nothing = Nothing
other g (Just(x, str1)) = Just(g x, str1)




sndFunction :: (String -> Maybe(b, String)) -> Maybe(a, String) -> Maybe(b, String)
sndFunction _ Nothing = Nothing
sndFunction fn2 (Just(x, str)) = fn2 str



-- which first runs p1
-- (which will consume some input and produce a function),

-- then passes the remaining input to p2
-- (which consumes more input and produces some value),

-- then returns the result of applying the function to the value.
-- However, if either p1 or p2 fails then the whole thing should also fail
-- (put another way, p1 <*> p2 only succeeds if both p1 and p2 succeed).


-- How is this useful?

-- type Name = String
-- data Employee = Emp { name :: Name, phone :: String }

-- we could now use the Applicative instance for Parser to make an
-- employee parser from name and phone parsers.
-- That is, if

-- parseName  :: Parser Name
-- parsePhone :: Parser String

-- then
-- Emp <$> parseName <*> parsePhone :: Parser Employee


-- is a parser which first reads a name from the input,
-- then a phone number, and returns them combined into an Employee record.
-- Of course, this assumes that the name and phone number are right next to each other in the input,
-- with no intervening separators.
-- We’ll see later how to make parsers that can throw away extra stuff that doesn’t directly
-- correspond to information you want to parse.



-- EXERCISE 3

-- We can also test your Applicative instance using other simple
-- applications of functions to multiple parsers.
-- You should implement each of the following exercises using the Applicative interface
-- to put together simpler parsers into more complex ones.
-- Do not implement them using the low-level definition of a Parser!
-- In other words, pretend that you do not have access to the Parser constructor
-- or even know how the Parser type is defined.



-- • Create a parser
-- abParser :: Parser (Char, Char)
-- which expects to see the characters ’a’ and ’b’ and returns them
-- as a pair. That is,
--   *AParser> runParser abParser "abcdef"
--   Just ((’a’,’b’),"cdef")
--   *AParser> runParser abParser "aebcdf"
--   Nothing
