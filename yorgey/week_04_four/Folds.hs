-- EXERCISE 1


-- Reimplement each of the following functions in a more idiomatic
-- Haskell style. Use wholemeal programming practices, breaking each function
-- into a pipeline of incremental transformations to an entire data structure.
-- Name your functions fun1’ and fun2’ respectively.

-- Hint: For this problem you may wish to use the functions iterate and takeWhile.
-- Look them up in the Prelude documentation to see what they do.

fun1 :: [Integer] -> Integer
fun1 []          = 1
fun1 (x:xs)
     | even x    = (x - 2) * fun1 xs
     | otherwise = fun1 xs



-- This is wrong
fun1' = foldl1 (*) . map (\x -> x - 2) . takeWhile (even)
-- fun1' = foldr (\x accum -> if (even x) then (accum * (x - 2)) else accum) 1
--fun1' =  foldl1 (*) . map (\x -> if (even x) then (x - 2) else 1)
fun1' :: [Integer] -> Integer


-- This is right, but it is not that wholemealish
fun1'' = foldl (\accum x -> if even x then accum * (x-2) else accum) 1





fun2 :: Integer -> Integer
fun2 1               = 0
fun2 n  | even n     = n + fun2 (n `div` 2)
        | otherwise  = fun2 (3 * n + 1)




-- Returns
-- Bool -> Integer -> Integer
h = \x -> if x then (`div` 2) else (1+).(3*)

-- Forces me to duplicate the last value
-- (h . even) 5 5

 --(1+).(3*)
f :: Integer -> Integer
f x = if even x then (x `div` 2) else (3 * x + 1)
fun2' =  foldl (\acc x -> if even x then acc + x else acc) 0 . takeWhile (>1) . iterate f
--fun2' =  foldl (\acc x -> if even x then acc + x else acc) 0 . takeWhile (>1) . iterate (h . even)






a = [1, 1, 1]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
c = [2, 4, 8, 3, 4, 2, 6]
d = [10, 7, 8, 6, 4, 3, 6, 7]



-- Confirmed. Sum can be implemented with both a left and right fold
sum' = foldl1 (\accum x -> accum + x)
sum'' = foldr1 (\x accum -> accum + x)


maximum' :: (Ord a) => [a] -> a
maximum' = foldl1 (\accum x -> if accum > x then accum else x)

maximum'' :: (Ord a) => [a] -> a
maximum'' = foldr1 (\x accum -> if accum > x then accum else x)

reverse' = foldl (\x acc -> acc : x) []






-- EXERCISE 2

-- Recall the definition of a binary tree data structure. The height of
-- a binary tree is the length of a path from the root to the deepest node.
-- For example, the height of a tree with a single node is 0; the height of a tree with three nodes,
-- whose root has two children, is 1; and so on.
-- A binary tree is balanced if the height of its left and right subtrees differ by no more than 1,
-- and its left and right subtrees are also balanced.


-- You should use the following data structure to represent binary trees.
-- Note that each node stores an extra Integer representing the height at that node.

data Tree a = Leaf
            | Node Integer (Tree a) a (Tree a)
    deriving (Show, Eq)


-- which generates a balanced binary tree from a list of values using foldr.



tr = "ABCDEFGHIJ"

-- bascially, the smaller letter is a child
-- is this important?

-- how do I do this?
-- start with the first node as the parent, and create a balanced tree under it
-- simple


-- STARTEGY A: Create a balanced tree

---- These functions replaces the current tree with a new one
--insertLeft :: Node -> Tree -> Tree
--insertLeft _ Leaf = error "Cannot insert left into a leaf"
--insertLeft new (Node _ m right) = Node (Node Leaf new Leaf) m right

--insertRight :: Node -> Tree -> Tree
--insertRight _ Leaf = error "Cannot insert right into a leaf"
--insertRight new (Node left m _) = Node left m (Node Leaf new Leaf)


-- STARTEGY B: Left, right, left, right

-- L, R,  LL, LR, RL, RR,  LLL, LLR, LRL, LRR, RLL, RLR, RRL, RRR
-- These look like permutations
-- Not quite


-- STARTEGY C: Recursive insert into unbalanced position

tree_a = Node 0 Leaf "A" Leaf
tree_b = Node 0 Leaf "B" Leaf
tree_c = Node 0 Leaf "C" Leaf
tree_d = Node 0 Leaf "D" Leaf
tree_e = Node 0 Leaf "E" Leaf
tree_f = Node 0 Leaf "F" Leaf
tree_g = Node 0 Leaf "G" Leaf

tree_ba = insertTree tree_a tree_b
tree_bac = insertTree tree_c tree_ba
tree_bacd = insertTree tree_d tree_bac
tree_bacde = insertTree tree_e tree_bacd
tree_bacdef = insertTree tree_f tree_bacde
tree_bacdefg = insertTree tree_g tree_bacdef


-- treeHeight, also disperses - and it is amazing that it comes to a conclusion
-- it assumes that all the child nodes have the correct height set
-- I'm not feeling a strong case for why I need it
treeHeight :: Tree a -> Integer
treeHeight Leaf = 0
treeHeight (Node h left _ right)
    | left_height >= right_height = left_height + 1
    | left_height <  right_height = right_height + 1
    where left_height = treeHeight left
          right_height = treeHeight right


-- [?] Can something that disperses, be folded?
-- There is a particular situation, which makes treeWeight necessary
treeWeight :: Tree a -> Integer
treeWeight Leaf = 1
treeWeight (Node h left _ right) = treeWeight left + treeWeight right



-- w_right <  w_left  = Node newHeight new n right

-- what is the evalation order of w_left?

-- insertTree does not disperse - it follows a dynamically decided path

-- TOOD: I can get rid the of the first pattern match, because I am not inserting
-- a tree into a leaf
-- wait, this is not true
-- maybe takeWhile will save me
insertTree :: Tree a -> Tree a -> Tree a
insertTree new Leaf = new
insertTree new (Node h left n right)
    | w_left  >  w_right = Node (treeHeight new_right) left n new_right
    | w_right <= w_left = Node (treeHeight new_left) new_left n right
    where new_left = insertTree new left
          new_right = insertTree new right
          w_left = treeWeight left
          w_right = treeWeight right



-- [?] Fold left works just as well
foldTree :: [a] -> Tree a
foldTree = foldr1 (\x acc -> insertTree x acc) . map (\x -> Node 0 Leaf x Leaf)



-- NEXT: A foldr implemention of insertTree




-- EXERCISE 3.1: More Folds
-- returns True if and only if there are an odd number of True values in the input list
xor :: [Bool] -> Bool
xor = foldl (\x acc -> if x then not acc else acc) False


-- EXERCISE 3.2: More Folds
-- implement map as a fold
map' :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map' f = foldr (\x acc -> f x : acc) []

-- EXERCISE 3.3: Implement foldl using foldr..




-- EXERCISE 4:

-- Implement the algorithm using function composition.
-- Given an integer n, your function should generate all the odd prime numbers up to 2n + 2.

cartProd :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
cartProd xs ys = [(x,y) | x <- xs, y <- ys]


-- [?] How do I do apply twice?
--sieveSundaram :: Integer -> [Integer]
--sieveSundaram =  cartProd (\x -> [1..x::Integer]) (\x -> [1..x::Integer])

-- start with a list of integers from 1 to n
source n = [1..n :: Integer]


--do_something = cartProd (source 9) (source 9)
initial = replicate 2 . (\x -> [1..x::Integer])


-- [?] I'm creating the matrix like this because I don't know how to apply twice
matrix n = cartProd (source n) (source n)




-- Remove all the values where i > j
filter_cart :: [(Integer, Integer)] -> [(Integer, Integer)]
filter_cart = filter (\(i,j) -> i <= j)

-- Now apply a multiplication on each element
do_mult = foldr (\(i,j) acc -> i + j + 2 * i * j : acc) []

-- Remove all the elements greater than: n

post_filter xs n = filter (\x -> x <= n) xs


cm = do_mult (filter_cart $  matrix 10)
dm = post_filter cm 10
em = remove_items (source 10) dm

-- now remove the items
-- i could use a list comprehension, or a foldr
--remove_items xs ys = [x | x <- xs, y <- ys, not (elem y xs)]
--remove_items xs ys = [x | x <- xs, y <- ys]

remove_items :: [Integer] -> [Integer] -> [Integer]
remove_items xs subs = foldr (\x acc -> if (elem x subs) then acc else x : acc) [] xs
